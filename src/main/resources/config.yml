# In this section, you can define aliases and permissions for each command.
# If you delete a command's settings, it's aliases entry and permissions list
# will be null which means it has no aliases other than the original command
# and it doesn't require a permission to be used.
#
# "permissions" entry is a list. You can define more than 1 perm if you want.
